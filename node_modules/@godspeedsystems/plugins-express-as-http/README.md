# Godspeed Express Plugin

## Introduction

The Godspeed Express Plugin is an integral part of the Godspeed framework, designed to facilitate the integration of event-driven and serverless functionalities into your projects. This plugin leverages the popular Express.js framework to handle HTTP events, making it easy to define event subscriptions and process incoming events.

## How to Use
- Create a godspeed project from the CLI and by default the Express plugin is integrated into your project if not, add the plugin from the CLI and select the `@godspeedsystems/plugins-express-as-http` to integrate the plugin.
```bash
godspeed plugin add

~~~~~~ Godspeed CLI ~~~~~~

? Please select godspeed plugin to install. 
  @godspeedsystems/plugins-cron-as-eventsource 
‚ùØ @godspeedsystems/plugins-express-as-http 
  @godspeedsystems/plugins-prisma-as-datastore 
  @godspeedsystems/plugins-axios-as-datasource 
  @godspeedsystems/plugins-aws-as-datasource 
  @godspeedsystems/plugins-mailer-as-datasource 
  @godspeedsystems/plugins-excel-as-datasource 
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```
- You will find the files in your project related to the Express plugin at `src/eventsources/types/express.ts` and `src/eventsources/http.yaml`.

### express.ts

```typescript
import { ExpressEventSource } from '@godspeedsystems/plugins-express-as-http';
export default ExpressEventSource;
```

### Express config (src/eventsources/http.yaml)

```yaml
type: express
port: 3000
```
### Express event (src/events/sample.yaml)
```yaml
http.get./sample_api:
    fn: sample      #redirects to src/functions/sample.yaml
    body: 
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              name: 
                type: string
              message: 
                type: string                         
    params:     
      - in: query
        name: user
        required: true  
        schema: 
          type: string   
    responses:      
      200:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: string
```
```yaml
http.<method>./<endpoint_url>:
    fn: <function_yaml>
    body:
    params:
    responses:
```
- The event YAML defines properties for handling specific HTTP requests within the Express app. In the YAML, `<method>` should be replaced with actual HTTP methods such as `GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE`, specifying how the app handles those requests. The `<endpoint_url>` field should contain the API URL for the respective HTTP route.
- A function will be triggered on sending a request to the respective url. The functions are created under `src/functions/`.

### Function to be called (src/functions/sample.yaml)
```yaml
summary:
description:
tasks:
    - id: example
      fn: com.gs.return #its an inbuilt function
      args: |
        <%"Hello "+inputs.query.user+". This is a message from body "+inputs.body.message%>
```

## How It Helps

The Godspeed Express Plugin provides the following benefits:

1. **Express Integration:** The plugin abstracts away the complexities of setting up an Express.js application, making it effortless to define routes and handlers for incoming HTTP events.

2. **Event Subscription:** Developers can easily subscribe to specific HTTP events by defining routes and handlers using a uniform API.

3. **Customizable Configuration:** The plugin allows for easy configuration of Express settings, such as port, request body limits, and file size limits.

4. **Integration with Godspeed Core:** The plugin works seamlessly with the Godspeed Core library, enabling the processing of cloud events and facilitating event-driven architecture.

## Plugin Explaination

This plugin is designed to integrate with the Godspeed framework and provides functionality related to event sources using Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework. It allows you to create event sources that can listen for incoming HTTP requests and trigger actions based on those requests.

## Plugin Components

The [plugin](/src/index.ts) consists of several key components:

### 1. `EventSource` Class

- This class extends `GSEventSource`, a base class provided by the Godspeed framework for creating event sources.

- It initializes an Express.js server to listen for incoming HTTP requests based on the provided configuration options.

- The `subscribeToEvent` method is used to define how the plugin should respond to specific HTTP routes. It maps incoming HTTP requests to Godspeed Cloud Events, processes them using a provided function, and sends a response.

- The `createGSEvent` static method is used to create a Godspeed Cloud Event from an incoming Express.js request.

### 2. Constants

- `SourceType`: A constant representing the source type of the plugin, which is 'ES' (event source).

- `Type`: A constant representing the loader file of the plugin. The final loader file will be located in the 'types' directory and named `${Type.js}`, where `Type` is 'express' in this case.

- `CONFIG_FILE_NAME`: In the context of an event source, this constant also serves as the event identifier. For a data source, it works as the data source name. In this plugin, it is set to 'http'.

- `DEFAULT_CONFIG`: A default configuration object with options like the port number for the Express.js server.


## Conclusion

Our Express plugin is a powerful addition to the Godspeed framework, allowing you to seamlessly integrate and manage event sources within your applications. With this plugin, you can effortlessly handle HTTP requests, define routes, and trigger actions, making it an essential tool for building robust and responsive applications.
